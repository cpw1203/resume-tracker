- Record important dates: submission, interview, follow-up.
- Search/filter applications.
- Export data to CSV or JSON.
- Persistent local storage.
- Optional data backup.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics  
- **Primary User:** Job seekers comfortable using a terminal.
- **Secondary User:** Recruiters or professionals managing multiple applications.

### 2.4 Operating Environment  
- Supported OS: Linux, macOS, Windows.
- Terminal emulator compatible.
- Local file system access for data persistence.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints  
- TUI framework dependency.
- Local storage format.
- Cross-platform support.

### 2.6 User Documentation  
- README with installation and usage instructions.
- Command reference or help menu.
